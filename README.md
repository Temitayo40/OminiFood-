## About Omnifood

It's a technology company first, but with a major focus on consumer well-being through a healthy diet.

## Branding

A healthy meal delivered to your door, every single day

### Summary

Users can use our app to select their diet and foods they like and dislike, and our AI algorithm will create a custom and individual weekly meal plan. But we don't stop there. We partner with restaurants and other cooking partners to actually cook and deliver all meals from the generated meal plans, in selected cities. All this will be packed up in a monthly subscription, where users can choose between receiving one or two meals per day, every single day of the month.

### Omnifood features

Never cook again!: Our subscriptions cover 365 days per year, even including major holidays.
Local and organic: Our cooks only use local, fresh, and organic products to prepare your meals.
No waste: All our partners only use reusable containers to package all your meals.
Pause anytime: Going on vacation? Just pause your subscription, and we refund unused days.
